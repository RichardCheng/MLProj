Usage:
The easiest way to use it is to import this project into Eclipse and run from 
there. 

Main decisions:
We used a proxy pattern on applying the split criterion, where when we passed
in min_error and max_gain criterion, the code to the tree will be reused, and 
the tree is built according to given criterion automatically. 

We also used a static factory to produce the nodes, so that when we need to 
change the type of node produced(different stopping parameter or different 
splitting criterion), we could simply change the parameter of that factory, 
while all other part of the code remains.
